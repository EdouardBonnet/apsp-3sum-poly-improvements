Modified for the independent Lax packaging by Édouard Bonnet, 2026.
Derived from 3sum-apsp/ThreeSumApsp/Spec/Sec2/Theorem5/Counters.lean at upstream commit e1a4e6508154ea59f030480661590a9fe3018011.
Changes: Lax module/namespace layout, separated concepts and proofs, archive
annotations, and compatibility with the archive Lean/mathlib environment.

# Quotients and remainders by counters

The word RAM has no division.  A program that runs through the rows `I = 0, 1, …, N - 1` of a matrix
can still know, for each row, its band, its block within the band and its offset within the block
(Section 2.3.4), that is `I / (K₀ N₀)`, `I / N₀ % K₀` and `I % N₀`: it keeps three counters and
steps them (`stepCtr`, `ctrAt_succ`).
