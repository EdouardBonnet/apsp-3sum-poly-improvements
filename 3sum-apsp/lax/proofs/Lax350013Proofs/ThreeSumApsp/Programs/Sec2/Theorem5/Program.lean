Modified for the independent Lax packaging by Édouard Bonnet, 2026.
Derived from 3sum-apsp/ThreeSumApsp/Programs/Sec2/Theorem5/Program.lean at upstream commit e1a4e6508154ea59f030480661590a9fe3018011.
Changes: Lax module/namespace layout, separated concepts and proofs, archive
annotations, and compatibility with the archive Lean/mathlib environment.
See NOTICE and README.md in the submission root for provenance and scope.

# Theorem 5: the program

The list of the procedures of Theorem 5's program, in the order of their numbers.  An entry is the
specification of a procedure together with a bound on its time, a constant times a shape.  In every
program that begins with this list, the procedures that the shared stage calls meet their entries
with the constant cShared5 (sharedCallees_of_prefix), and those that the solver calls with the
constant cMain5 (mainCallees_of_prefix).
